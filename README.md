4. Error Handlings
5. Loggers
6. Custom Exceptions
 

# Assignment Deadline : 18th March 10 AM 

# Minimum Qualification requirement: Should be hosted on any one for the free hosting platforms, github repository can be public or you can give collaborator access to (grx10.social@gmail.com)  

 

# Inputs:  

1. Average monthly electricity bill  

2. Rooftop area available(m2) 

3. Phone number 

# Output: 

1. Number of panels needed 

2. Required Area for Rooftop Solar 

3. Capital needed to install the suggested number of panels 

4. Breakeven years 

5. Next 25-year earnings after installation of solar 

 

Add a lead capture mechanism which stores the phone number in a database of your choice. 

UI design can be very simple with input and output fields with a polished look.  

 

# Assumptions: 

1. Each panel has 500W capacity 

2. Each panel size is 2m x 1m size 

3. Number of panels = Average monthly electricity bill / 420 (assumed constant) 

4. Capital required to install 1 kW solar is Rs. 60000 

 

# Refer Example 

 

Example: 

Input:  

Average electricity bill: Rs. 2500  

Rooftop area available: 100 m2 

Output: 

Number of panels needed: 6 (logic in assumptions) 

Required Area for Rooftop Solar: 12 m2  (logic in assumptions) 

Capital needed: Rs. 1,80,000 (logic in assumptions) 

Breakeven years: 6 years (figure out the logic) 

Next 25 Years earnings because of solar: Rs. 5,70,000 (figure out the logic)  

 

Build it using any tech stack you are comfortable in but it should be fullstack (frontend, backend and database).  

Respond with links to hosted website and the github repository.
